# Assignment 3

### ID: 11016071

This assignment thought me a lot.
In this project, there was only on screen so I used App.js as my only screen.
In there, I created 4 components, thus, I divided the screen into 4 parts and each hwas a component.
I worked on each separately and then inported them into the App.js file once I was done.
The componets were Header, Search, Categories and Ongoing.
For this project, I used the View, Text, ScrollView, TextInput, Stylesheet, Image components.

### View
The View component is like a <div> in web development.
It's a container that helps with layout and styling. You can nest other components within a View, and it's commonly used to structure UI elements.

### Text
The Text component is used to display text content.
It's similar to the HTML <span> or <p> elements. You can style text using various props such as style, fontWeight, fontSize, etc.

### ScrollView
The ScrollView component is used to enable scrolling when the content within the component exceeds the dimensions of the viewport.
It's useful for displaying long lists or content that users can scroll through.

### TextInput
The TextInput component provides a way for users to input text.
It's like the HTML <input> element. You can use it to create input fields for forms, search bars, chat messages, etc.

### StyleSheet
The Stylesheet module provides a way to create styles in React Native.
It's similar to CSS, but with some differences. You define styles using JavaScript objects and then apply them to components using the style prop.

### Image
Image: The Image component is used to display images.
You can use it to show static images from your project directory or dynamic images fetched from a server. It supports various props for styling and handling different aspect ratios.
